# Graful Day

**Graful Day** is a simple Android application that I wrote for a Vietnamese group to practice gratitude based on the book "The Magic" in 28 days.

Users can use the app 2 ways:
* New users: practice 28 days orderly from day 1 until day 28
* When users are done with the 28-day: They can click on random button to pick random day for revising
